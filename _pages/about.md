Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a fourth year Ph.D student at [Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/index.html), China. In HITSZ, my research is supervised by Prof. [Shaohua Wu](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/wushaohua). Currently, I am also a visiting student at [Institute for Infocomm Research, A\*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r) in Singapore, where I am supervised by Prof. [Sumei Sun](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r/about-i2r/i2r-management/sun-sumei). 

I received my Bachelor's degree in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen) in 2020. I was also a visiting student at [University of California (Riverside)](https://www.ucr.edu) in USA in 2017.

Research Interest
======
1. Performance analysis of channel coding in the **Finite Block-Length (FBL)** regime. My research work about **Spinal codes** has been published in *IEEE ISIT*, *IEEE Transactions on Communications*, *IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications*, and *IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology*.
2. Performance modeling and optimization of URLLC-oriented physical-layer communications, with a specific interest in **Age of Information (AoI)** analysis and optimizations. My research work about AoI has been published in *IEEE Globecom*, *IEEE Transactions on Communications*, *IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications* and *IEEE Journal on Selected Areas of Information Theory*.
3. Goal-oriented and semantic communications. My research work about **goal-oriented and semantic communications** has been published in *IEEE Transactions on Communications*, *IEEE Wireless Communications*, and *IEEE WCNC*.
