Welcome to my homepage! <u>I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D student</u> at [Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/index.html), China. In HITSZ, my research is supervised by Prof. [Shaohua Wu](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/wushaohua). Currently, I am also a visiting student at [Institute for Infocomm Research, A\*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r) in Singapore, where I am supervised by Prof. [Sumei Sun](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r/about-i2r/i2r-management/sun-sumei). 

<u>I received my Bachelor's degree in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen) in 2020</u>. I was also a visiting student at [University of California (Riverside)](https://www.ucr.edu) in USA in 2017. I am a positive young volunteer for many IEEE events, such as [IEEE VTC-Spring 2024 Singapore](https://events.vtsociety.org/vtc2024-spring/), [IEEE 6G Summit Singapore 2023](https://sg6gws2023.ieee-sg6gws.org/), and [IEEE 6G Summit Singapore 2024](https://sg6gws2024.ieee-sg6gws.org/); and a reviewer for IEEE top-tier journals and conferences, such as [IEEE TWC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7693), [IEEE ISIT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/1000369/all-proceedings), [IEEE TNNLS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=5962385), [IEEE TVT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=25), [IEEE CL](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=4234), etc.

Currently, I am actively exploring job opportunities and post-doctoral positions.
