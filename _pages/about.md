Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a four-year Ph.D. student at the Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), China, under the supervision of ***Prof. Shaohua Wu***. Currently, I am also a visiting student at Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in Singapore, where I am supervised by ***Prof. Sumei Sun***. 

I received my Bachelor's degree in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen) in 2020. I was also a visiting student at University of California (Riverside) in USA in 2017.

Research Interest
======
1. Performance analysis of channel coding in the Finite Block-Length (FBL) regime. My research work about **Spinal codes** has been published in IEEE ISIT, IEEE Transactions on Communications, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, and IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology.
2. Performance modeling and optimization of URLLC-oriented physical-layer communications, with a specific interest in Age of Information (AoI) analysis and optimizations. My research work about **AoI** has been published in IEEE Globecom and IEEE Transactions on Communications.
3. Goal-oriented and semantic communications. My research work about goal-oriented and semantic communications has been published in IEEE Transactions on Communications and IEEE Wireless Communications.
