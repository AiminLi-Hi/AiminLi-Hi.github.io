Spinal codes, a family of rateless codes introduced in 2011, have been proved to achieve Shannon capacity over both the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and the binary symmetric channel (BSC). In this paper, we derive explicit tight upper bounds on the error probability of Spinal codes under maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding and perfect channel state information (CSI) over three typical fading channels, including the Rayleigh channel, the Nakagami-m channel and the Rician channel. Simulation results verify the tightness of the derived upper bounds.
