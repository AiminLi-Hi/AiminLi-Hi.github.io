Spinal codes are a new family of rateless codes which have been proved to be capacity-achieving over both the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and the binary symmetric channel (BSC). However, over the Rayleigh fading channel between the vehicle nodes, the error performance of Spinal codes is not satisfactory since the tail message blocks of Spinal codes are prone to error. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a new practical partial self-concatenation coding structure of Spinal codes, named N tail-protected Spinal codes, to pointedly protect tail message blocks of Spinal codes over the flat Rayleigh fading channel. Theoretical performance analysis and simulation results are also provided to validate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed N tail-protected Spinal codes.
