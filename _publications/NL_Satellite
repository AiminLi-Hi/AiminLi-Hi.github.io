With the development of space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), the Low Earth Orbit Satellite Communication (LEO SatCom) network has great potential to provide high rate communication services for aeronautical traffic. To overcome the frequency handovers between aircraft and LEO satellites, we generated a global aeronautical traffic demand map and utilized the graph-based handover (GBH) framework and the multi-attribute decision making (MADM) algorithm jointly to optimize the overall throughput. Moreover, we further propose a new parameter, called channel reservation order (CRO), for MADM algorithm. Simulation results indicate our strategy improves the performance in terms of overall throughput and access failure probability.
