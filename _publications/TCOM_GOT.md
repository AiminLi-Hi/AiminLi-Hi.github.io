Optimizations premised on open-loop metrics such as Age of Information (AoI) indirectly enhance the systemâ€™s decision-making utility. We therefore propose a novel closed-loop metric named Goal-oriented Tensor (GoT) to directly quantify the impact of semantic mismatches on goal-oriented decision-making utility. Leveraging the GoT, we consider a sampler & decision-maker pair that works collaboratively and distributively to achieve a shared goal of communications. We formulate a two-agent infinite-horizon Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) to conjointly deduce the optimal deterministic sampling policy and decision-making policy. To circumvent the curse of dimensionality in obtaining an optimal deterministic joint policy through Brute-Force-Search, a sub-optimal yet computationally efficient algorithm is developed. This algorithm is predicated on the search for a Nash Equilibrium between the sampler and the decision-maker. Simulation results reveal that the proposed sampler & decision-maker co-design surpasses the current literature on AoI and its variants in terms of both goal achievement utility and sparse sampling rate, signifying progress in the semantics-conscious, goal-driven sparse sampling design.
